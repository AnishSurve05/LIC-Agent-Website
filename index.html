        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">An endowment policy is a life insurance contract designed to pay a lump sum after a specific term (on its 'maturity') or on death. Typical maturities are ten, fifteen or twenty years up to a certain age limit.   Policies are typically traditional with-profits or unit-linked including those with unitised with-profits funds the holder then receives the surrender value which is determined by the insurance company depending on how long the policy has been running and how much has been paid into it. Pension insurance provides many benefits. They can be used as a low-risk way to save. Policyholders can choose how much to pay each month and how long they want to stay, usually for 10 or 20 years.</p></div>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Term life insurance or term assurance is life insurance that provides coverage at a fixed rate of payments for a limited period of time, the relevant term.

If the life insured dies during the term, the death benefit will be paid to the beneficiary.</p></div>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Health insurance or medical insurance is a type of insurance that covers the whole or a part of the risk of a person incurring medical expenses. As with other types of insurance, risk is shared among many individuals. By estimating the overall risk of health risk and health system expenses over the risk pool, an insurer can develop a routine finance structure, such as a monthly premium or payroll tax, to provide the money to pay for the health care benefits specified in the insurance agreement.</p></div>
